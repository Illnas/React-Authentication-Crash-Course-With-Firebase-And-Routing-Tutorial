<h2>React Authentication Crash Course with Firebase and Routing Tutorial<h2>

This is only tutorial that I could find on Firebase that was this long. Only after I finished it
did I realise it was unneccessarily long. But good thing is I did find bunch of things I need to learn.

First thing to learn would be this try and catch in async functions. I did see this type of code but I never understood it's 
purpose nor usage. This crash course did open my eyes a bit to importance of it.

Second thing, would be routing. I think when I saw it properly I almost screamed of happiness!
I was thinking of how to make buttons link to different html files and switch between them in React. Thankfully,
answer to that problem hit me while I was doing this crash course and that is: Routing! Going to spent more
time learning and testing routing.

Third thing, would be bootstrap in react! It blew my mind that syntax would be kinda different,
which leads to having to learn how to do that too! Plus, need to research how to use Sass with
React too.

More or less, I did get more things to learn and it kinda feels I did not learn anything 
from this crash course, which is completely my fault. Well, I got introduced to Firebase which is good thing
and now I am off to do few more tutorials on firebase and MobX.

Let's go!!!
